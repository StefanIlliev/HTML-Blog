                <p>'There’s been a fair bit of hype surrounding the latest SpaceX upright rocket landing.
                    Simple as it seems, the excitement Sci-Fi Today, Reality TV Tomorrow, at least for me,
                    stems from how the feat has brought us one step closer to fulfilling our sci-fi
                    fantasies – etched into our minds by the many blockbuster flicks Hollywood has produced.
                    If you can recall one of the opening scenes of The Martian, we witnessed the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) lifting off,
                    attempting to escape an ensuing dust storm. While most of the focus was on the misfortune of Mark Watney – played by Matt Damon,
                    left behind after being struck by debris, you could say we took for granted how easily the MAV ascended into space.
                    Combine the thought of how the MAV got there in the first place, and you have yourself
                    a similar parallel to the SpaceX launch and landing. So what am I getting at? Science fiction only remains science
                    fiction until technology catches up with our imagination. This applies not just to space travel, but every other
                    area of technological advancement.</p>

                        <p>How To Deal With Class Imbalance And Machine Learning On Big Data.
                            ', 'As data scientists, we work with a large amount of diverse data.
                            A common task for us is supervised statistical classification.
                            Classification underpins many activities that are a part of our everyday lives.
                            Emails are classified as spam or not spam, credit card purchases are classified as
                            fraudulent or legitimate, and custom web advertisements are shown to people based on their viewing habits.
                            A ubiquitous, yet difficult problem in machine learning classification is class imbalance,
                            which occurs when one class occurs far less frequently than the others. For example,
                            how do you create a classifier to detect fraudulent transactions
                            if only 1% of all transactions are fraudulent? In this post, I take a deep-dive into class imbalance,
                            discussing the challenges associated with large datasets and approaches to tackle the class imbalance problem.</p>
